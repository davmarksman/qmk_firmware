# Finally decided to take the plunge and move of qwerty

Possible options:
- Dvorak
- RTSHD
- Colemax
- Custom

Tasks:
[] Start logging keys
[] Research layouts 


Input scope analysis:
 
- Bkspace
- Shift
- Space
- E

# General
- Thinking should move = to a more ergonomic place? It and minus require a finger spray motion but typing them seem to has a high accuracy
- Esc position? Check frequency, corner equals position or thumb key?
- Also when coding (), {}, and [] auto complete. So maybe try mapping sdf to those and above them to their close. Will free up 2 keys on main

# Open questions/Design considerations

1. Want control key mod on home row Middle finger postion
2. Programming focused
3. Thumb E?
4. Digraph th?


# Dvorak
- + Kinesis has labels for this
- ; is in an horrible positions on the left hand. But . is in a great position
- Moves alot of keys

# Coleman DH Mod
o Not important for me: Copy paste designed to be in same place but don't really use those keys but balanced by their position is fine on my weakest fingers
